## About

Knative Eventing provides tools for routing events from event producers to sinks, enabling developers to use an event-driven architecture with their applications. Apache EventMesh supports the CloudEvents specification, thus it could be integrated with Knative as an event broker.


## Background

### Apache EventMesh

[Apache EventMesh](https://github.com/apache/incubator-eventmesh) is a dynamic cloud-native eventing infrastructure used to decouple the application and backend middleware layer, which supports a wide range of use cases that encompass complex multi-cloud, widely distributed topologies using diverse technology stacks.

### Knative

[Knative](https://knative.dev/docs/) is a platform-agnostic solution for running serverless deployments. [Knative Eventing](https://github.com/knative/eventing), one of Knative components, is a collection of APIs that enable developers to use an event-driven architecture with their applications. Developers can use these APIs to create components that route events from producers to consumers.


## Contribution
### Task
- ✅ Learn the details of the CloudEvents specification
- ✅ Learn the basics of Knative Eventing and its communication protocol
- ✅ Implement the EventMesh Knative-Connector module to deliver events to Knative  

*Note: All planned tasks for GSoC' 22 are done.*

### Deliverable
- ✅ Source Code
- ✅ Integration Test
- ✅ Documentation

*Note: All deliverables for GSoC' 22 are reviewed and approved by the community.*

## Design and Implementation
### Architecture

The architecture of EventMesh-Connector-Knative is depicted as Figure 1. To connect EventMesh to Knative, we need to consider two event routing directions.

The first direction is from EventMesh to Knative (black line). User sends an request to EventMesh, which defines an event message header and asks EventMesh to publish (EventMesh-Connector-Knative/KnativeProducer) this event message to the Knative broker. Knative sink subscribes event message, which can be handled by Knative Eventing component.

The second direction is from Knative to EventMesh (red line). Knative source sends an event message to the Knative broker. EventMesh subscribes (EventMesh-Connector-Knative/KnativeConsumer) the event message accoding to given topic from the Knative broker. After that, the event message can be consumed by user.

### Demo

#### Preparation
We use  [```cloudevents-player```](https://github.com/ruromero/cloudevents-player) as Knative source and sink. We use an [InMemoryChannel-backed Knative broker](https://knative.dev/docs/getting-started/first-broker/). We clone the Apache EvnetMesh GitHub repository. All these installation steps are done on a cloud server.

#### Demo-01: Publish an Event Message from Knative and Subscribe from EventMesh

> Step 1: Start an EventMesh Server

  </p>
</div>
<br><br>

> Step 3: Subscribe from EventMesh

The event message with ```data``` field as ```Hello CloudEvents!``` will be printed on the console of EventMesh server.

## Conclusion

In this project, we design and implement an EventMesh-Connector-Knative module that connects Apache EventMesh to Knative. In this way, Apache EventMesh obtains the ability of Knative and developers can directly use Apache EventMesh to enable Knative functions.

## Future Work

In the future, we plan to add Apache EventMesh as a thrid-party broker to the Knative community. I will also keep contributing to the Apache EventMesh community and try to make EventMesh-Connector-Knative module meet the requirements in the production environment.
